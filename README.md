# Age Estimation Regression - Abstract

In this report we aim to show a possible approach for the Age Estimation regression task. In particular, our solution consists of both using the features provided with the dataset and extracting some statistics from the spectrogram of each audio file. The submissions of the prediction of each model are evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Our model has been put in competition with other models and obtained overall good results, outperforming the naive baseline.

# The software is written as a Jupyter notebook named "age_estimation_project.ipynb".

To run the code the following python libraries are needed:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- librosa
